# Big Tech (FANNG) Turnover Rates

Analyzed a dataset of thousands of job reviews of former employees at elite tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. The goal was to find out why the turnover rate at these companies were so high, given the vast majority of people who say it is their dream to work there. 

Used a varitey of Python tools to analyze the data such as pandas and numPy, while using sentiment analysis and natural language processing to process the text within each review. You will find graphs and procedure in 'Exploring Tech Giants.pynb'
